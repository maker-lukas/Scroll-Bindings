# Scroll Wheel Keybinds

A client-side Fabric mod that allows you to bind the scroll wheel to any keybind in Minecraft. Scroll up and scroll down are treated as assignable keys in the vanilla Controls menu — just scroll while a keybind is waiting for input.

## Features

- Bind scroll wheel up and scroll wheel down to any in-game keybind
- Three modes: Keybinds (scroll triggers bound actions), Vanilla (default behavior), Disabled (scroll does nothing)
- Works directly through the vanilla Controls screen, no extra configuration menus
- Client-side only, no server required
